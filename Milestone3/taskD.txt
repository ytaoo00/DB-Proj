Task D:

For D, I have written the interface focused on using invoice. I have written a interface which loaded the dummy data and potentially will evolve to a function which will allow the user to update data from their local machine. But for now it is just for loading the dummy data. If you click on this function you will be direct to a page that shows a branch of errors. The errors are caused by loading data with repeated primary keys. 
â€¨For this assignment, I have written three interface which can view, add, and find interface by ID. The view invoice which present the invoice already inside the database. The add invoice will allow the user to create new invoice into the database. Once added, one can check the new data base by clicking the view invoice page. The find invoice will allow the user to search interface by ID.

Thanks.
